To retrieve specific data from a database using SQL. You will learn how to focus on relevant rows and columns, sort results, and limit output for better analysis.

🔍 Step-by-Step Process:

1. ✅ Basic Data Extraction with SELECT
The SELECT statement is used to fetch data.
Syntax:
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;
Examples:
SELECT * FROM customers;         -- Select all columns
SELECT name, age FROM customers; -- Select specific columns
2. 🔎 Filtering Results with WHERE
Use WHERE to fetch only rows that meet specific conditions.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition;
Examples:
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE country = 'India';
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age > 30;
You can also use:
AND / OR — combine multiple conditions
LIKE — for pattern matching
BETWEEN — for range checks
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE age BETWEEN 25 AND 40;
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name LIKE 'A%';
4. 🔃 Sorting Data with ORDER BY
Use ORDER BY to arrange rows in ascending or descending order.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC|DESC;
Examples:
SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY age ASC;
SELECT * FROM orders ORDER BY order_date DESC;
5. 📉 Limiting Results with LIMIT
Use LIMIT to restrict the number of rows returned.
Syntax:
SELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT number;
Example:
SELECT * FROM customers LIMIT 5;
6. 🔗 Joining Multiple Tables (Optional for Basic Practice)
If you need to get data from two or more related tables, use JOIN.
Example:
SELECT customers.name, orders.total_amount
FROM customers
JOIN orders ON customers.id = orders.customer_id;

✅ Result:
By combining SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT, you can:
Retrieve only the data you need
Filter and refine results
Sort them logically
Control how much data is displayed
